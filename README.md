# ESPHome ESP32 UPPÅTVIND

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmacstn/ESP32-IKEA-UPPATVIND/main/images/pcb-3D.png)

This project aims to transform the IKEA UPPÅTVIND air purifier into a smart air purifier that can be controlled through the Home Assistant platform. The project utilizes ESPHome as its source code.

To accomplish this, a custom controller board equipped with an ESP32 microcontroller is utilized in place of the original board without requiring any modifications to the air purifier. The schematic for the custom controller board can be accessed through this repository. However, the PCB design is currently unavailable for sharing.
